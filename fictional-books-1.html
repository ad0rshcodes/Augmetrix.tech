                  Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling
                </div>
                <p>
                  All the Potterheads have at least once dreamt of receiving their very own letter
                  from Hogwarts! I know that almost everybody recommends these books but here I go…
                  This series, written by JK Rowling, revolves around a teenager’s life in the
                  Wizarding World. The protagonist, Harry Potter, faces several challenges in his time
                  at Hogwarts which he combats along with his two best friends Ron and Hermione
                  (friendship goals everybody!!). He makes several friends and more than a few enemies
                  in the course of 7 books.
                  I recommend this enthralling series because it’s more than just a huge part of my
                  childhood. Harry Potter is not a novel series, it’s a lifestyle!! It can take you on
                  adventures, make you feel love, betrayal, sorrow and a lot more!!

                  The Martian by Andy Weir
                </div>
                <p>
                  We’ve all thought about astronauts going to Mars and exploring life and water there.
                  But what if someone got stranded on Mars? Survival becomes the top most priority for
                  Mark Watney, a botanist and mechanical engineer, as he’s left alone on Mars by his
                  fellow astronauts on the Ares 3 mission due to their presumption that he’s dead.
                  It’s 2035 and Mark has lost connection with NASA. To go back to Earth, he needs to
                  wait for the members of the next Ares mission that is supposed to land a thousand
                  kilometers away from where he is now. As Watney takes notes about his life on Mars,
                  the reader relates to him and even laughs many times. Andy Weir’s detailed writing
                  never misses to grab the reader’s attention throughout the book.

                  Bodyguard by Chris Bradford
                </div>
                <p>
                  Do you crave action and adventure? Seriously do you? Then you NEED this series on
                  your bookshelf. Bodyguard is one of the most underrated book series I have ever come
                  across. It talks about the life of a teenager, Connor Reeves, who lost his father at
                  a very young age. His father died during an operation, while body-guarding the US
                  president. Connor is recruited by an agency called Bodyguard which recruits kids
                  around his age to protect kids around his age, one can say in Colonel Black’s words-
                  to act like the last ring of defence. As you’ll flip through the pages, you’ll find
                  yourself rooting for Connor and his fellow buddyguards. You’ll fight along with them
                  to protect someone and you’ll definitely fall in love with the characters.
