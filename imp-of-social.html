                                    Other than our classic social networking applications, many teens nowadays are
                                    turning towards a more professional platform, LinkedIn.
                                    In more than one way, LinkedIn actually proves to be helpful in shaping a teen’s
                                    career.
                                    In today’s competitive world, getting into a college is harder than ever. Being on
                                    LinkedIn helps students look for jobs or internships which will help in building
                                    their college profile. It also helps them connect with people who can further guide
                                    them on their journey and also with like minded teens who are themselves on the road
                                    of building a better future.
                                    Having a good LinkedIn profile is also a great way of “marketing” yourself to
                                    employers or admission officers. On this platform, one may also stumble upon several
                                    opportunities, which may help one in not only boosting their profile but to gain
                                    experience in various fields of knowledge. In conclusion, linkedin has helped
                                    teenagers grow professionally and is an overall good platform for networking.

                                <p>
                                    Often seen as a negative influence by adults, Instagram is a big convenience for
                                    everyone if used in the right way. According to a survey conducted in 2021, 81% of
                                    Indian teens ranked Instagram as their favourite social media app. The present
                                    generation doesn’t lack talented people and hence everybody’s always in the search
                                    of a platform to showcase their talent. Instagram provides a free and ideal platform
                                    for teens to interact with the worldwide public. Moreover, one has the advantage of
                                    conducting live sessions with one’s followers. One can even make money by grabbing
                                    the attention of various sponsors. Lastly, gradually a lot of small businesses are
                                    shifting online to attract a larger audience hence Instagram has become even a
                                    shopping hub.

                                    Snapchat

                                    This social networking app owns the heart of almost every teenager. It is a fairly
                                    creative app which can lift people’s mood with its quirky filters. Moreover,
                                    Snapchat focuses on chatting with friends rather than merely posting status updates,
                                    like some of the other apps, allowing teens to maintain a bond.
                                    On the darker side, this app has led to body shaming in many individuals. ​​Snapchat
                                    filters manipulate the image of the user’s face or body shape, which can result in
                                    self-shaming and confidence dip once the filter disappears.
                                    In conclusion it’s a fairly good and secure app when it comes to clicking pictures
                                    and building a network of friends, but it can also give rise to self hatred and
                                    further negativity.

                                    Twitter is more likely to be used by the older teens rather than the younger ones.
                                    Unlike other social networking sites (like Instagram and Snapchat) where one usually
                                    communicates with only those one wants to, Twitter enables a person to have an open
                                    conversation with anyone and everyone. It has become a source of information for
                                    many. Even a lot of influential leaders have taken to Twitter. Also, in this era of
                                    aware citizens, it has become a popular platform to address one’s unheard issues. A
                                    tweet made publicly contributes to a lot of pressure on the party against whom the
                                    complaint has been tweeted.
